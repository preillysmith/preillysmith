# Hi, I'm Patrick ðŸ‘‹

## About me:

I am a resourceful and focused project developer, focusing on tech development, with a wide-ranging and adaptable skill set. I strive to combine creativity and efficacy to produce innovative and engaging solutions. 

I'm currently enrolled in a Web Development bootcamp with HyperionDev, which is giving me new skills and insight with HTML, Javascript and CSS to build on my initial coding experience with SQL.
